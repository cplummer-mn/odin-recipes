        <h3>  Example waffle paired with whipped cream, syrup and mango.</h3>

        <h4> Description:</h4>
        
        <p>These buttermilk waffles are crisp on the outside and tender in the middle.
             I love the results this gives while not having to separate the eggs and 
             take time to whip egg whites! These will also reheat in the toaster for a 
             quick workday breakfast.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups low-fat buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions:</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl until evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk buttermilk and melted butter together in a separate bowl; whisk in eggs. Stir buttermilk mixture into flour mixture until just combined and batter is slightly lumpy; stir in vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Preheat a waffle iron according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>To cook each waffle, pour enough batter into the preheated waffle iron to reach 1/2 inch from the edge. Cook according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <h5>You can heat the oven to about 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C), and place a rack on a baking sheet to keep waffles warm as you make the whole batch.</h5>
